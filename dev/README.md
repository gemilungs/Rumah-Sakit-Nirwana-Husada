# Dev helpers (disabled)

All development helper scripts that previously lived in this directory have been **disabled and moved** to `php/dev_disabled/` on 2025-12-17 for security reasons.

If you need to restore a helper for local development, copy the specific file from `php/dev_disabled/` back into this directory and verify it is only accessible from `localhost` before re-enabling.

Do NOT commit enabled dev helpers to public repositories or production servers.
